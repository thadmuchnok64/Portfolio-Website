                            <p> Fantastic question. I'm Thaddeus, or "Thad" for short. I am currently a Computer Science and Digital Arts
                                student
                                at the University of Florida, expecting to graduate in Summer 2023. I am planning to take 
                                a masters in VR and AR with UF Digital Worlds (MiDAS) in Fall 2023. I love to develop
                                games and software; and work on art such as animating, modeling, or technical art. What a 
                                coincidence that both of these skills have such a wide overlap in Game Design.
                                <br /><br />
                                My most recent role was in the Summer of 2022 where I interned at Nelnet. Nelnet was a 
                                great learning experience for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity I had while 
                                working alongside the talented developers there. For more details, please check out 
                                my timeline section to the side.
                                <br /><br />
                                I was a programmer for 6 Game-Jams and counting. From those jams, I have won two awards.
                                Game jams have helped me work towards getting better at my passion while getting to spend 
                                time with some of my favorite people.

                                <p> Currently, I am enrolled in a Masters Program at UF. My goal as a career is to become a technical artist. 
                                    Naturally, learning more of the art-side of development is going to be neccesary if I am going to be working 
                                    with both artists and developers. The program specializes in 3D Art, animation, new technologies such as AR/VR, 
                                    and more. I am super happy that I got into the program, as I have already learned so much already, and enjoyed 
                                    the company of the friends I have made, and the professors I greatly respect.

                                <p> Summer 2022, I interned at Nelnet. I worked on the development team: creating over a

                                    cases, fixing bugs, implementing new features, attending daily standups, and
                                    communicating with other
                                    branches of the company. One of the major things I worked on, was migrating the project 
                                    to FlaUI, a more stable framework for testing mobile UI.<br/>
                                    The experience I had here was invaluable; I learned so much in the way of mobile 
                                    and web development, and I heavily refined my programming abilities and practices.

                                    My project was a gravity simulation game. It was super enjoyable to program the physics
                                    of the project; because as well as being fun, it was also rooted in real science and served
                                    as a great learning experience.

                                    One significant thing I did in this position was develop an algorithm to generate
                                    random rooms for a player to transverse through. I also worked on improving the organization
                                    of the group. I organized the goals and objectives of the project into a format similar
                                    to industry (Scrum) standards.

                                <p> The culmination of my Operating Systems class was to develop a file system which would be 
                                    attached to the OS of our virtual machine we were modding. In this project, we had to take 
                                    a <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/WAD#:~:text=WAD%20(acronym%20for%20%22Where's%20All,be%20either%20IWADs%20or%20PWADs." target="blank">WAD File</a>, 
                                    and organize all the data into directories which were mounted onto the OS file browser. This 
                                    allowed you to navigate through the WAD data as read-only files, while using the interface of the OS.

                                <p> For my Software Engineering class, I was the project manager for the project our team was making.
                                    This involved communicating with the school club who was our "client," and seeing what they wanted
                                    from the project we were making them; planning out team member responsibilities, working on the code,
                                    and other planning and documentation.

                        <h1>Lumenblade</h1>
                        <p>This was a project for my 3D animation class with professor Karlson at the University of Florida.
                            I was extremely proud of this when I finished it. I remember going in with a completely different 
                            aesthetic in mind; initially it was going to be very colorful and take place in a forest during a sunrise.
                            After I rendered the scene for the first time, I accidentally used too little light; however, I ended 
                            up being really impressed with what was rendered as it had a dark and unique aesthetic that I had 
                            not seen in many animations prior. I am very happy that I made that mistake, as I feel like the end product 
                            I ended up with, was better than I imagined; which is saying a lot considering its usually such a challenge 
                            for an artist to put their vision completely into the art that they make.

                        <h1>Outline Shader</h1>
                        <p>When working on my game, I was starting to feel that the game needed a graphical style change 
                            that fit with the low-poly aesthetic of the world. I thought that adding an outline to 
                            all of the meshes would create an interesting look. I am very happy with the end result as 
                            one of my friends in the MiDAS program described it as looking like a fairytale illustration.

                        <h1>Doom AR Game</h1>
                        <p>This was one of the first projects I worked on when I started the MiDAS program. I was super excited 
                            to start working with new technologies like AR and VR. I thought that I should make something familiar 
                            when starting out to help with the unfamilar technologies. Naturally, I picked Doom, one of my favorite 
                            game franchises, to make a game with assets from the original games.

                        <h1>Enemy Models</h1>
                        <p>Here's some of the models that I made for my current, and most ambitious 
                            project to date. I am working on a game where you play as an Angel going 
                            down from Heaven into the underworld. The designs are inspired by biblically accurate angels, and holy crusaders. 
                            For each enemy, I modeled, UV'd, rigged, and animated them myself.
                            I am trying to model the enemies based around the weapons that the player has. 
                            For example, if the player has a shotgun with a wide spread, they would be smart to use it on 
                            the enemies with a wider frame such as the crusaders. On the 
                            other hand, a weapon that has more precision but less damage would be best 
                            at countering the skinnier angels with three rings.
