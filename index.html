                            <p> Fantastic question. I'm Thaddeus, or "Thad" for short. I am currently a Computer Science and Digital Arts
                                student
                                at the University of Florida, expecting to graduate in Summer 2023. I am planning to take 
                                a masters in VR and AR with UF Digital Worlds (MiDAS) in Fall 2023. I love to develop
                                games and software; and work on art such as animating, modeling, or technical art. What a 
                                coincidence that both of these skills have such a wide overlap in Game Design.
                                <br /><br />
                                My most recent role was in the Summer of 2022 where I interned at Nelnet. Nelnet was a 
                                great learning experience for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity I had while 
                                working alongside the talented developers there. For more details, please check out 
                                my timeline section to the side.

                                I was a programmer for 6 Game-Jams and counting. From those jams, I have won two awards.
                                Game jams have helped me work towards getting better at my passion while getting to spend 
                                time with some of my favorite people.

                                <p> Summer 2022, I interned at Nelnet. I worked on the development team: creating over a
                                    hundered test
                                    cases, fixing bugs, implementing new features, attending daily standups, and
                                    communicating with other
                                    branches of the company. One of the major things I worked on, was migrating the project 
                                    to FlaUI, a more stable framework for testing mobile UI.<br/>
                                    The experience I had here was invaluable; I learned so much in the way of mobile 
                                    and web development, and I heavily refined my programming abilities and practices.

                                    My project was a gravity simulation game. It was super enjoyable to program the physics
                                    of the project; because as well as being fun, it was also rooted in real science and served
                                    as a great learning experience.

                                <p> In fall of 2021, I joined this internship where I worked with a team of ~10 other students.
                                    One significant thing I did in this position was develop an algorithm to generate
                                    random rooms for a player to transverse through. I also worked on improving the organization
                                    of the group. I organized the goals and objectives of the project into a format similar
                                    to industry (Scrum) standards.

                                <p> The culmination of my Operating Systems class was to develop a file system which would be 
                                    attached to the OS of our virtual machine we were modding. In this project, we had to take 
                                    a <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/WAD#:~:text=WAD%20(acronym%20for%20%22Where's%20All,be%20either%20IWADs%20or%20PWADs." target="blank">WAD File</a>, 
                                    and organize all the data into directories which were mounted onto the OS file browser. This 
                                    allowed you to navigate through the WAD data as read-only files, while using the interface of the OS.

                        <h1>Lumenblade</h1>
                        <p>This was a project for my 3D animation class with professor Karlson at the University of Florida.
                            I was extremely proud of this when I finished it. I remember going in with a completely different 
                            aesthetic in mind; initially it was going to be very colorful and take place in a forest during a sunrise.
                            After I rendered the scene for the first time, I accidentally used too little light; however, I ended 
                            up being really impressed with what was rendered as it had a dark and unique aesthetic that I had 
                            not seen in many animations prior. I am very happy that I made that mistake, as I feel like the end product 
                            I ended up with, was better than I imagined; which is saying a lot considering its usually such a challenge 
                            for an artist to put their vision completely into the art that they make.

                        <h1>Enemy Models for my Metroidvania Game</h1>
                        <p>Here's some of the models that I made for my current, and most ambitious 
                            project to date. I am working on a game where you play as an Angel going 
                            down from Heaven into the underworld. The first enemies that you encounter 
                            in the game are my unique spin on biblical angels. I am trying to model the 
                            enemies based around the weapons that the player has. For example, if the 
                            player has a shotgun with a wide spread, they would be smart to use it on 
                            the enemies with a wider frame such as the crusaders to the right. On the 
                            other hand, a weapon that has more precision but less damage would be best 
                            at countering the skinnier angels with three rings. I nicknamed those angels 
                            "brushheads" because their hair kind of looks like a paintbrush :D
